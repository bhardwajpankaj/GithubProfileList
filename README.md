# Task
a simple GitHub Direct Messaging app.

## A & B. 
* This sample code can be used to coach a junior to tell how things work and also if we want to grow this sample as large project,
* we have followed MVVM design patern in this which is quite easy to seperate API Logic, Business Logic and models. And this is also simple to understand.
* We have not used any third party library for Data mapping or Image downloading, that helps in understanding the Junior how things are working as good as for a large project as well. 


# Specifications
